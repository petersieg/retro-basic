99.99..% the work from: https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/tree/main

Consider the repo above as the main repo! Please find new/updates/issues there.
I might as time allows make an update here from time to time. The creator Stefan is ok with my copy.
(I just did not wanted to do a normal fork, with 90% in it, that was not of my primary interest).

I just used the basic2/posix leaf to create a MAC DMG easy installer in Jan. 2026 version 2.0.

Folders:

bas = only few examples basic source programs (.bas and .txt are both basic sourcecode)

doc = contains manual.md, the basic language manual for this interpreter

src = sourcecode files

basic_lion = under Mac OSX Lion compiled basic interpreter. 

basic_bigsur = under Mac OSX Big Sur compiled basic interpreter. 

basic_lion.dmg = DMG Image with basic application, ready to run/install(copy) to applications folder.

This basic_lion.dmg should also run up to MAC OSX Big Sur.

Retro Basic Interpreter in C

99.99..% the work from: https://github.com/slviajero/tinybasic/tree/main

Consider the repo above as the main repo! Please find new/updates/issues there.
I might as time allows make an update here from time to time. The creator Stefan is ok with my copy.
(I just did not wanted to do a normal fork, with 90% in it, that was not of my primary interest).

I just used the basic2/posix leaf to create a MAC DMG easy installer in Jan. 2026 version 2.0.
